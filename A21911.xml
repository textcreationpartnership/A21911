            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Queenes Maieſtie being infourmed of ſundry great diſorders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in and about her Citie of London, by vnlawfull great aſſemblies of multitudes of a popular ſort of baſe condition, whereof ſome are Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes and ſeruants to Artificers, and to ſuch like as are not able or not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to rule their ſeruants as they ought to doe, And ſome attempting to reſcue out of the handes of publique Officers ſuch as haue bene law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully arreſted, whereby her Maieſties peace hath bene of late notably violated and broken, to the diſhonour of her Maieſties gouernment, and chiefly for lacke of due correction in time of ſuch manifeſt offenders by the Officers of her Citie and others in the places round and about her Citie: For reformation whereof, her Maieſtie hath had conference with her Counſell, of the moſt ready meanes both for puniſhment of ſuch offences al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready committed, and for ſtay of the like. And to that purpoſe doeth moſt ſtraitly charge all her Officers both in the Citie, and in places neere to the Citie, in the Counties of Middleſex, Kent, Surrey and Eſſex, that haue authoritie to preſerue the Peace, and to puniſh the offenders of the Peace, That they do more diligently, to the beſt of their powers, ſee to the ſuppreſſion of all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt the Peace, And eſpecially of all vnlawfull aſſemblies, vpon paine to be not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued from their Offices, but to be alſo puniſhed as perſons maintayning or rather comforting ſuch offenders. And becauſe theſe late vnlawful aſſemblies and rowtes are compounded of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſorts of baſe people, ſome knowen Prentiſes, ſuch as are of baſe Manual occupation, and ſome others wandring idle perſons of condition of Rogues and vagabonds, and ſome colouring their wandring by the name of Souldiers returned from the warres: Therefore her Maieſtie hath for better direction to her Officers of Iuſtice, and for the inquiſition and knowledge of all ſuch kinde of perſons, ſo either vnlawflully gathering themſelues in companies or wandring about like Vagabonds, without any knowen maner of honeſt liuing, notified her pleaſure to her Counſell, to preſcribe certaine Orders to be publiſhed in and about the ſaide Citie, which ſhe will haue ſtraitly obſerued. And for that purpoſe meaneth to haue a Prouoſt Marſhall with ſufficient authoritie to apprehend all ſuch as ſhall not be readily reformed &amp; corrected by the ordinary Officers of Iuſtice, and them without delay to execute vpon the gallowes, by order of Martiall lawe. And theſe her Maieſties commandements, She willeth to be duely obſerued, vpon paine of her indignation.</p>
